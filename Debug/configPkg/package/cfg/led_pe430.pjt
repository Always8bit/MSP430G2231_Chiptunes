CustomBuildOutput="led.xe430"

;  Don't use 'xdc clean' command here because this also deletes the project
;  file that is currently open.  This causes the command to hang waiting for
;  CCS to close the file, which it doesn't do (of course).
;
;  Instead we only clean out those files associated with the target used to
;  build the executable.

;  Always run the xdc command since this command is the one that tracks

;
Run=Always

;
;  We need to exclude these from the build or provide a command to run from
;  the directory containing the file; otherwise CCS complains about not
;  being able to "build" this file.  Adding a custom build step causes CCS
;  to run this *in addition* to the project build above; thus we do nothing
